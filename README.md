#Welcome!
Welcome to Athens E-Board Rental GitHub Repository! This is an old company website where the company rented out boosted boards to college students. The code and files in this repository are for archival purposes only.

The site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is organized into separate files and directories.

Please note that the site is not live and cannot be accessed through a web browser. It is intended solely as a historical record of the company's online presence.

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to contact us via the issue tracker. I'll will do our best to assist you with your inquiry.

Thank you for looking at this old project!
